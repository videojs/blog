In preparation for the next version we&rsquo;ve moved the source code repository from github.com/zencoder/video-js to [github.com/videojs/video.js](http://github.com/videojs/video.js)

If you have a local clone you can update your clone&rsquo;s upstream URL with:

<pre>git remote set-url upstream git://github.com/videojs/video.js.git</pre>

The relationship between your fork (e.g. github.com/you/video-js) should still be intact, including any pull requests.

Cheers,
