Smallish update with some fixes and optimizations. Rewrote the subtitles parser so it&rsquo;s a lot more optimized and fixes a subtitle display bug. Put in a check for Safari running on Mac OSX 10.5 (Leopard), which doesn&rsquo;t like native fullscreen for some reason. Triggering full window mode instead.

Full List

*   Feature: Rewrote and optimized subtitle code.
*   Feature: Protecting against volume ranges outside of 1 and 0.
*   Fix: Bug in Safari for Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) that was breaking fullscreen.
