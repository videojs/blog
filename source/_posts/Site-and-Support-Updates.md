After a brief hiatus of helping [Brightcove and Zencoder come together](http://blog.videojs.com/post/35666994917/brightcove-acquires-zencoder "Zencoder acquired by Brightcove"), I&rsquo;m moving full time to developing and supporting Video.js. Thank you to everyone who has continued to commit code and help out in the forums. 

As part of this move I&rsquo;m trying to optimize the tools used for video.js project management and support. The first big change is that the forums are being replaced with [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/video.js "Video.js Support on Stack Overflow") (tag with &ldquo;video.js&rdquo;) and [Github Issues](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/issues "Video.js Submit Issues").

Over the last few years Video.js has become more popular than I ever expected, and at the same time Stack Overflow has come up as an incredible tool for supporting developer communities. So along with many other projects like [Facebook](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/facebook-stackoverflow/ "Facebook on Stack Overflow"), [Android](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/12/hello-stack-overflow.html "Android on Stack Overflow"), and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com "HTML5 Boilerplate"), I&rsquo;m excited to move support to Stack Overflow&rsquo;s awesome tool and community. I&rsquo;ll be leaving the forums up for bit but from here forward please post questions to Stack Overflow and use the &ldquo;video.js&rdquo; tag.

I&rsquo;ve also begun cleaning up and organizing the [Github Issues](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/issues "Video.js Submit Issues") for Video.js, which previously existed, but issues were split between the forum and Github. If you find specific bugs with video.js please [submit them there](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/issues/new "Submit Issue").

On the project management side of things I&rsquo;ll be using [Trello](https://trello.com "Trello"), and exposing boards so others can see the progress of development.

I&rsquo;m also paring down the site and moving more complex sections to other services that can better handle them. I&rsquo;ve already moved the blog to [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com "Tumblr"), and I&rsquo;m moving the docs to the [Github repo](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/tree/master/docs/index.md "Video.js docs"), which has built-in docs formatting.

For those starting an open source project today, you can look at this as my guide to supporting an open source project. I wish I would have know to do all this when I started on Video.js.

More project updates coming soon.

Cheers,
