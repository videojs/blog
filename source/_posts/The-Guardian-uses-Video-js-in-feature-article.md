It&rsquo;s always nice to find Video.js in the wild, but this [article from The Guradian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded) is an especially cool use case. Most of the players don&rsquo;t use controls at all, but rather play/pause based on the user scrolling the page. The ones that do use controls are styled with a white on light gray theme that matches the rest of the page really well.

**The article begins with a full-width video that includes controls.**

**Most of the videos are short dialogs that are triggered based on scrolling to a certain point in the page. These have no controls other than an external play/pause button.**
