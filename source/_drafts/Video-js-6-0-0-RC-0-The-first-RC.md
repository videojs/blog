## Release Candiate Released
Last week, we published the first Release Candidate (RC) of Video.js 6.0 on npm.
This was a months-long team effort to make Video.js even better.
However, to do so, we had to make a few breaking changes.

## What to look forward to
There are several big things that changed in Video.js 6.0.
* We're finally removing flash from core as outlines in [a previous post](http://blog.videojs.com/the-end-of-html-first/).
* Plugins are being updated to a React-inspired component architecture. (The old style is staying around).
* We're recommitting to accessiblity by fixing the accessibilty of our volume control and bringing back outlines!
* Middleware. A brand new feature to interface between Video.js's techs and the player.

## Feature Spotlights
Over the coming few weeks, wee'll post feature spotlights talking about the big new things that are happening.
We might also revisit some old features as well.
